# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
My motivation for this Prework Study Guide Webpage was to try and get a better understanding of how VS code works, as well as how each different element of making a website works and whats involved in making a website fluent and easy to use from both a user and a developers point of view.

- Why did you build this project? 
I built this project for a starting point in my webdev career. To understand the basics of how to make a website, and gain knowledge of how things work. And to always have something to look back on for help and guidance, and to see how far I advance come the end of the course.

- What problem does it solve?
The problem this website solves is teaching the basics of coding, and being able to troubleshoot lines of code where the input was wrong, or needed a little bit of tweaking in order to make it work effectively and the way it was intended.

- What did you learn?
I learnt how to use and what; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git are. The coding I learnt here will greatly improve the websites to come and the basic fundamentals of how a webpage should act and look.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used as a starting point, and a point of reference to come back too if one ever gets stuck. How this can help if I was to get stuck at any point is by looking at the notes left in each section regarding the topics discussed. eg: HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript.

Through the code, it also show how the DevTools Console can be used and can also be seen running the JavaScript code we implemented, by how it lists topics from the prework and will choose a topic for us to strudy first.

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
